# chromebrew-rpm-noinstall
rpm-noinstall is an extremely simple script wrapper for rpm that prevents rpm from installing any rpm files on a chromeos machine with chromebrew

### Purpose
To solve the issues listed on [chromebrew pull #4945](https://github.com/skycocker/chromebrew/pull/4945)

### Contributing
When creating an issue, please ensure the issue isn't about the rpm.rb file in the main chromebrew repository.
When creating a pull request, please request a merge into the dev branch as rpm.rb downloads from the master branch.
